# Sinvite
Sinvite (sunc-chan) is the Discord bot which allows the sUNC's official Discord server (and some others) to run smoothly.

It was originally a bespoke product designed for [sUNC](https://sunc.su) under the Numelon Bespoke "Open Source and Small Project Programme", but has since been transferred as a personal project of [Richy](https://richy.lol).

Sinvite runs on [Kavun Cloud](https://kavun.cloud).
